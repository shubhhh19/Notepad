# Notepad
A console application built using C# in Visual Studio Community. It provides basic text editing functionalities.

## Features
- Basic Text Editing: Provides a platform for users to write, edit, and manage text documents.
- Cut, Copy, Paste: Allows users to manipulate text within the editor.
- Save and Save As: Enables users to save their work to a file on their system.

## Installation
Compile the source code in Visual Studio Community or any other C/C++ compiler.

## Interesting Parts during the Build Process:
- Implementing Cut, Copy, Paste: It was fascinating to figure out how to manipulate text within the console environment, managing text buffers, and efficiently handling user input.
- File I/O: Implementing the save and save as functionalities involved working with file input/output operations, which was enlightening

## Difficulties Faced and Solutions:
- Dealing with User Input: It was hard to make sure the program understood what I wanted to do with the keyboard. I fixed it by finding ways to handle keyboard actions better.
- Managing Files: Figuring out how to save and open files was tough. I solved it by learning more about how files were handled and fixing any problems that came up.
